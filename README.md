# Pokemon_EDA
This mini-project, guided by Mr. Shivanand Sir, analyzes the Pokémon dataset using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. In collaboration with a friend, we explored Pokémon stats, type distributions, and trends using EDA and visualization techniques. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook, dataset, and report.
